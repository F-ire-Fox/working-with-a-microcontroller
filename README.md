# working-with-a-microcontroller
Hi all.
I am a student at a technical institute.
I had the opportunity to get a job within the institute.
my future employer gave me a “test task”: to figure out how the program works and what it is for.
the only thing I found out is that this program is a project for working with a microcontroller.
After digging a little on the Internet, I didn’t find anything useful.
I remembered about this wonderful Github platform.
I ask for help, dear programmers.
I'm really interested in this section of programming and I'd like to get into it.
I hope you can help me with mastering this section of programming.
Maybe you know and can recommend some educational literature, websites, forums on this topic?
in any case, I will be glad for any help.
I will upload the project that was given to me.
I look forward to your comments and thank you in advance for your time.
